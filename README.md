# knockout
 This respository is my first project for the basics of programming at the Białystok University of Technology
## quick code overview: 
 Tournament where the loser of each match-up is immediately eliminated from the competition

### instructions: 
 A certain number of teams take part in the competition. 
 Each of them is labeled by: 
 * name
 * city
 * website address
 * contact email  
 
 A team must have one or more players, one of them is the captain.
 Each team member has:
 * name  
 * surname  
 * age  
 
 After entering the data and starting the competition, program randomly creates the order of matches.
 
 If the number of teams is not a power of two, empty spaces are filled with empty data which means that some participants will go straight to the next stage.
 
 The user can fill in the results of the next matches and choose the winners up to the final.
 
 Each team may also be disqualified at any stage.
